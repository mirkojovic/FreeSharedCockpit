    added on 12-02-2019:
    -Create a single common script file for both master and slave computers
    -Allow toggle of control inputs between master and slave, the toggle button (on the master computer) should:
      Slave: Enable the physics model
      Master: Disable the physics model
      Slave: Stop setting aircraft position, attitude, velocities from the master
      Master: Set aircraft position, attitude, velocities from the slave

    -Untoggling the switch should perform the above but in reverse
    -Create a GUI for the toggle button, Slave/Master IP address and Ports input box, connect button
    -Sync the engine on/off state
    -Sync the cockpit/autopilot switches
    -Optimise for speed - cut down precision of variables, code cleanup
    -Write an instruction manual 
    -Required dependencies
